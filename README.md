# 👋 Hi, I’m Bini  

I am a Data Scientist focused on building high‑stakes decision systems for healthtech and fintech. I bring strong execution in SQL, Python, and BI tools, supported by a TPM background that helps me frame ambiguous problems with clarity, build trust with stakeholders, and deliver analytics that drive confident decisions.

## What I Focus On
I focus on building high‑stakes decision systems in healthtech and fintech, where correctness, transparency, and trust are essential. My work centers on translating ambiguous business and operational questions into structured analytical problems that can be solved with SQL, Python, and clear modeling assumptions.

I specialize in decision contexts involving risk, uncertainty, and regulatory constraints, including clinical risk assessment, fraud detection, and compliance‑driven analytics. My background in technical program management strengthens my ability to surface hidden constraints, align cross‑functional stakeholders, and ensure analytical work is decision‑ready rather than purely exploratory.

Across projects, I prioritize clarity in problem framing, rigor in modeling, and communication that builds confidence in how insights are produced and used. The goal is not just accurate models, but decision systems that teams trust and adopt in real‑world, high‑stakes environments.

## Selected Data Science Projects
- Accounting Fraud Detection
  Deep learning and ensemble modeling to detect financial reporting fraud in public companies. Built a generalized fraud detection framework using neural networks and tree‑based ensembles, with a focus on interpretability and decision thresholds suitable for regulatory and audit contexts.

- Loan Default Probability Modeling
  Large‑scale credit risk modeling using a 2.4GB structured lending dataset. Developed feature engineering pipelines and ensemble probability models to estimate default risk, support risk segmentation, and inform portfolio‑level decision making.

- Healthcare Access Disparities Analysis
  Quantitative analysis of healthcare access gaps using CDC NHIS 2023 survey microdata. Applied statistical modeling and demographic stratification to surface inequities in access and generate policy‑relevant insights for health systems and decision makers.

## Modeling Philosophy
I approach data science as the design of decision systems, not just the production of models. In high‑stakes environments, the goal is to reduce uncertainty in a way that decision makers can understand, trust, and act on, even when the data is imperfect or the constraints are real.

My work emphasizes clear problem framing, explicit assumptions, and modeling choices that balance predictive performance with interpretability. I favor approaches that make tradeoffs visible, surface sources of risk, and support decisions under uncertainty rather than optimizing for metrics in isolation.

Across healthtech and fintech use cases, I prioritize transparency, robustness, and communication as first‑class requirements. Strong models matter, but durable impact comes from analytics that are explainable, aligned with operational realities, and integrated into how teams actually make decisions.
